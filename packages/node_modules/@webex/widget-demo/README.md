# Widget Demo

This package allows a developer to easily load and instantiate both the
recents widget and the space widget on a single page.

As the name implies, this is used as a quick demo and not meant for
production use.

## Starting

To start this demo, simply run `npm run start:package widget-demo` and
load your browser to http://localhost:8000/
